# Ford GoBike Data Exploration

This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, we'll be conducting an exploratory data analysis using Python data science and data visualization libraries. In the second part, we'll take our main findings from your exploration and convey them through an explanatory analysis. 

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 295,854 Ford GoBike trips from January 2020, 
including duration and other trip characteristics. The dataset has been suggested by Udacity 
and can be found at https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data. 

## Key takeaways

(1) Though duration variable takes on a large range of values, the typical trip 
duration is between 300-700 seconds (5-12 minutes). This has been reveled by both 
zooming into part of histograms most of the data points lie and by logarithmic 
transformation.

(2) Customers take longer rides than subscribers, with more customers than subscribers 
taking rides on weekends proportionally. This is revealed by 

(3) Specific stations don't shift patterns for user types and rental access method: 
customers and app users take longer rides. However, most popular stations account 
for proportionally longer trips on weekdays, not weekends. This is not the case for 
the majority of data.
